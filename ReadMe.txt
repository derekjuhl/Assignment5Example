This is a minimal ADO Example. It contains a login class and a class to return
some information about the donor.

the passwords are passed in plain text--a bad idea, but done here for simplicity.

It uses the CommunityAssist Database which is available at 
http://www.spconger.com/school/ITC172/CommunityAssist.txt

It also requires some changes to the database these and a description of the whole project 
can be found in the blog entry at
